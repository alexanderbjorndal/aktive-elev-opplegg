- Database edit (in browser?)

Possible Next Steps
Add pagination or categories if the list of opplegg grows large.
Add edit/delete opplegg for admins (and maybe for the author).
Add user profiles (see their opplegg and comments).

Search & Discovery
Filter & sort → filter opplegg by traits, grade levels, or categories.
Tag cloud / category browser → a visual way to explore opplegg by traits instead of searching by text.

User Experience
User profiles → not just a page, but showing: uploaded opplegg, comments, favorites, and maybe their “teaching focus” traits.
Follow / subscribe → let teachers follow each other or get notified when someone adds a new opplegg.
Favorited-by counter → each opplegg shows how many teachers favorited it (popularity indicator).

Opplegg Enhancements
Preview snippet → short description / summary auto-generated from the opplegg text (instead of showing full wall of text everywhere).

Smart Features
Live similarity check (you mentioned this — very strong idea!).
Recommendation system → “Based on what you liked or uploaded, here are opplegg you might want to see.”
AI-assisted tagging → when writing an opplegg, the system suggests traits automatically based on the description.

Layout & Access
Responsive design (your idea: mobile-friendly layout).
Export opplegg → let teachers download an opplegg as a nicely formatted PDF to share offline.

Admin Tools
User management panel → reset password, deactivate accounts, promote users to admin.
Bulk add approved emails (upload CSV).
Analytics dashboard → see most active users, most favorited opplegg, most common traits.
Moderation queue → approve new opplegg before publishing (optional).
